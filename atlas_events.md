# ATLAS events

Beams of protons collide at the centre of the ATLAS detector producing collision debris in the form of new particles which fly out in all directions. Over a billion particle interactions take place in the ATLAS detector every second.

The protons within the two beams are grouped in bunches which are squeezed down in size to increase the chances of a collision.  The bunches cross about every 25 ns.  We get around 20 collisions per **bunch-crossing**.  

An **event** is the data resulting from a particular bunch-crossing. 

Proton-proton collisions in addition to the collisions of interest are collectively referred to as **pileup**.  Pileup presents a serious challenge to physics analyses at the LHC.

The above event display shows a candidate Z boson decaying into two muons with 11 reconstructed vertices. This event was recorded on April 24th and is typical for the 2011 environment with high pileup.

The **primary vertex** stems from the high transverse momentum inelastic collision of two protons.  It is important to correctly identify it from the many low transverse momentum proton-proton interactions, so called minimum bias events.

The reconstruction of primary vertices is important for
many physics studies, including searches for new particles, identifying jets containing b-quarks or taus and reconstruction of exclusive b-quark decays.

## Data 
The ATLAS collaboration has released 1 inverse femtobarns (fb^-1) of data on the CERN open data portal, **ATLAS Public Release Spring 2016**.

One [inverse femtobarn](http://writing-guidelines.web.cern.ch/entries/inverse-femtobarn) corresponds to approximately 100 trillion (1012) proton-proton collisions.

## Simulated data
Simulated events are a key feature for the LHC
experiments, commonly named Monte Carlo (MC). These events are used to compare theory with the real
data.

The full simulation requires the following steps
* Event generation: Hadronic final states using the
proton-proton collisions are generated using programs relying  on  theoretical  calculations,  phenomenological
models and experimental inputs.

* Detector Simulation: Interaction of the generated
particles inside the ATLAS detector is simulated.

* Digitization: The detector response is derived from
the particle interactions and it is written in a format
compatible with the real output of the detector. In addition,
because of the high rate of collisions in the LHC, digitized
signals from several simulated events can be piled-up to
create samples with a realistic experimental background.

* Reconstruction:  particle trajectories and energies
from the detector are reconstructed. Such final samples
are used by the physicists.

## Comparing data and simulated data

Data and simulated data do not always agree.  This can be due to various reasons, such as

* the conditions not being exactly the same e.g. Energy, pileup etc.

* not all background processes are included in the simulated data. 

* the physics has not been exactly modeled by the theory.

If the data and simulated data does not agree, it is important that physicists understand why.

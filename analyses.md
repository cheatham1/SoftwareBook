# Analyses

We have prepared seven analyses for you.  Ranging from measuring Standard Model particles, a Higgs analysis and a search for a beyond the Standard Model particle.

## W Analysis and Z Analysis

The W and Z bosons are together known as the weak or the intermediate vector bosons. These Standard Model elementary particles mediate the weak interaction.  

It is important to measure well known Standard Model particles, to confirm that we understand properly the detector and software.  We are then ready to search for new physics.

## Top pair Analysis

The top pair analysis is interesting since it is a good test of the Standard Model.

It is important for discrimination between different data simulation generators,  QCD models and parton distribution functions.

In addition, top pair production is an important background in various Higgs boson analyses as well as beyond the Standard Model searches, and it is therefore crucial to understand this process in detail. 


## WZ Analysis

This analysis looks for both a W boson and a Z boson.
It is a relatively clean signature due to three leptons in the final state.  It is interesting for physics since it is a probe for triple gauge couplings.

## ZZ Analysis

This analysis looks for two Z bosons where both Z bosons decay to leptons.  

The Higgs boson decaying to two Z bosons which in turn decay to 4 leptons is known as the golden channel.
The importance of this channel was shown by its major role in the discovery of a Higgs-like boson, by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, with mass near 125 GeV. 

## HWW Analysis

This analysis searches for the standard model Higgs boson produced via the vector-boson fusion mechanism. 
The main background is top pair production in association with one or more jets. 

## Z' Analysis

The Z' boson is a hypothetical gauge boson that arises from extensions of the electroweak symmetry of the Standard Model. The Z' is named in analogy with the Standard Model Z.

# Analyses

## W Analysis

This analysis implements the criteria for single W boson events with the W boson decaying to leptons. 

## Z Analysis

This is a Z boson analysis where the Z boson decays into a lepton pair. 

## Top pair Analysis

Top pair analysis is interesting since it is a good test of the Standard Model (SM).
It is important for discrimination between different data simulation generators,  QCD models and parton distribution functions.
In addition, top pair production is an important background in various Higgs boson analyses as well as beyond the SM searches,
and it is therefore crucial to understand this process in detail. 


## WZ Analysis

This analysis looks for both a W boson candidate and Z boson candidate.
It is a relatively clean signature due to 3 leptons in the final state.  It is interesting for physics since it is a probe for triple gauge couplings.

## ZZ Analysis

This analysis looks for two Z boson candidates where both Z bosons decay to leptons.  


## HWW Analysis

This analysis searches for the standard model Higgs boson produced via the vector-boson fusion mechanism. 
The main background is top pair production in association with one or more jets. 


## Z' Analysis

The Z' boson is a hypothetical gauge boson that arises from extensions of the electroweak symmetry of the Standard Model. The Z' is named in analogy with the Standard Model Z.

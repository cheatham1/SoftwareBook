# ATLAS open data

Welcome to ATLAS at the LHC.  
We have prepared some data for you.  Come and take a look.  
It is ready for you to use, just for curiosity, as a teaching tool or to dive in and write your own analysis code.  

This section is aimed at University students and post graduate researchers.  We expect you to have a good level of software skills.  Failing that, a good amount of motivation to follow the various steps.

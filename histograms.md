Here we can see the number of vertices in this top pair analysis (TTbarAnalysis)  ranges from around 0 to 25.
The data and simulated data have a similar shape.  However there is a slight offset due to ... 

We also see that the number of jets  varies from 4 to 9.  Simulated data shows a similar distribution of numbers of jets.
